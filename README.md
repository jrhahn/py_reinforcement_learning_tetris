# Reinforcement Learning for playing Tetris

## Description

This project is about learning an agent to play Tetris using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

The code contains an implementation of the the game tetris which can also be played as a normal game. The more interesting part is the AI that aims at learning how to play the game.

## Status

Training will take a long time. So far I was not able to train a good AI - you need a lot of simulations until by chance a row is filled. To lead the agent the right direction, I give some reward if there are many blocks in a row - the more it is filled, the better. 

Still, I cannot guarantee that the implementation is free of major bugs.
